       <h2><b>"Follw your dreams,believe in Yourself & don't give up."</b></h2>We have to stand up for what we believe in, even when we might not be popular for it. Honesty starts with being ourselves, authentic and true to who we are and what we believe in, and that may not always be popular, but it will always let you "Don't give up on your dreams, or <b>follow your dreams and your heart.</b> <mark>your dreams will give up on you."</mark>> </p>
